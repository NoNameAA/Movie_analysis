Problem need to be solved:

1. What makes a movie gain more profit?
  -> genre of movie? subject? director? specific actors? original control?
  -> catch cost and box office to check the relationship?
  -> which factors are the most related?
  -> if the movie gains good profit which can also gets good reviews?


2. what makes a movie gain better reviews from critics or the general audience?
  -> genre of movie? subject? director? specific actors? original control? cost? box office?
  -> the relationship between critics and the general audience, if they have similar or different ideas?
  -> which factors are the most related?
  -> if the movie gains good reviews which can also gets good profits?

3. what is the defination of success for a movie?
  -> critic review? audience reviews? profit or loss?
  -> if these factors have correlate with each other?
  -> which one is better or worse kinds of â€œsuccess?

4. Can we predict the review scores from other data about the movie?
  -> genre of movie? subject? director? specific actors? original control? profit? cost? box office?
  -> which factors are the most related?

5. Can we use plot summary to predict the genre?
  -> use "Natural Language Processing"

6. Have any things changed over time depending on movies' date?
  -> maybe people in the past like documentaries more than right now
  -> maybe the profit of movie in the past is below
  -> maybe most of the previous movie comes from a same country, but nowadays different countries have their own movies

7. If audience and critic rating means are different
